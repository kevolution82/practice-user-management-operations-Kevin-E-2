In this exercise I learned how to pull data from multiple tables using JOINs, and how to group and summarize that data with GROUP BY and aggregate functions. I also practiced filtering data with WHERE and HAVING, and worked with SubQueries to make my queries more dynamic.

The tricky part was remembering the difference between WHERE and HAVING since one filters before grouping and the other filters after. Subqueries took a little extra brain power because you have to think about how the database handles them behind the scenes and where they fit inside the main query.
